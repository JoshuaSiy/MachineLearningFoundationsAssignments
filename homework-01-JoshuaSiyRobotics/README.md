## Additional Notes

Template code named "hw01.py" has been provided to you for this assignment.  While this is a good place to start, there are many things missing from the code.  It is up to you to fill them in!  You are not limited to using just what is in the template.  Feel free to add any vizualizations/ metrics that will help you understand the underlying processes/ methods.

If you import any additional packages or add any vizualizations, **make sure to add them to the travis.yml file**.

Good luck!
